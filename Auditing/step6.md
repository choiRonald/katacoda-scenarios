# Step 6: Grafana Alert
Grafana alerting allows you to attach rules to your dashboard panels. When you save the dashboard, Grafana extracts the alert rules into a separate alert rule storage and schedules them for evaluation.

The alerting engine publishes some internal metrics about itself. You can read more about how Grafana publishes internal metrics. See also, View alert rules and their current state.
