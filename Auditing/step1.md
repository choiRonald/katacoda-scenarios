# Step 1: Install and set up Grafana

### Grafana
Grafana provides a dashboards for viewing metrics. By monitoring the data from our WordPress. For instance it can show the recent query execute and the general log, error log, which can monitor if any invalid user using the WordPress or Database.

We can set up Grafana by using either individual container or YAML file as common practice. Create the file `docker-compose.yml` as follows. The configuration file will startup you WordPress, MySQL and Grafana containers. The three containers can communicate through the docker network. Also, the port `80` in the WordPress application is mapped to the host port `20080`. 

```sh
version: '3.2'
services:
    mysql-server:
        container_name: mysql
        ports:
            - "13306:3306"
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 12345
            MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
            MYSQL_USER: wordpress_user
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
        image: mysql/mysql-server
        command: 
            --general-log=ON
            --log-output=TABLE
        volumes:
            - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    wordpress:
        image: wordpress:latest
        container_name: wordpress
        ports:
            - "20080:80"
        environment:
            WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql-server:3306
            WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress_user
            WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: secret
        depends_on:
            - mysql-server 
    grafana:
        container_name: grafana
        image: grafana/grafana
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        environment:
            ADMIN_USER: "ADMIN"
            ADMIN_PASSWORD: "ADMIN"
```

After the file have been saved, execute the follow command to start up the container.

> `docker-compose up`{{execute}}
